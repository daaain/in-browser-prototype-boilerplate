# A single HTML prototyper with React + Babel + Foundation + Sheetrock

No toolchain setup, no server (works off file:///).

Loads all libraries from CDNs (which also get cached) so speed is "decent enough".

Sheetrock enables you to load sample data in from a Google Spreadsheet. It also works with private spreadsheets the currently logged in user has access to in the browser youâ€™re loading the file in.
