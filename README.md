# A single HTML prototyper with React + Babel + Foundation + Sheetrock

A simple boilerplate for getting started with ES6 React (compiled runtime with Babel) and Foundation's default CSS.

No toolchain setup, no server (works off file:///). Loads all libraries from CDNs (which also get cached) so speed is "decent enough".

On top of these Sheetrock enables you to load sample data in from a Google Spreadsheet. It also works with private spreadsheets the currently logged in user has access to in the browser youâ€™re loading the file in.
